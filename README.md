#  Explainable AI Diabetes Prediction Project

**Machine Learning & Healthcare Analytics Project**

This project focuses on building **explainable machine learning models** to predict diabetes risk using the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**. Beyond prediction, the project emphasizes **interpretability**

**Important:** This project is for **educational and analytical purposes only**. It is **not medical advice** and should not be used for healthcare decisions.


##  About This Project

Healthcare datasets often have class imbalance (fewer positive cases than negative cases), which can bias models toward the majority class. In this project, you will:

* Explore the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset
* Tackle class imbalance with:

  * Random Undersampling
  * Random Oversampling
  * Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)
* Build and evaluate machine learning models with a focus on **recall for positive cases**
* Apply explainability tools:
  * **LIME** for local explanations
  * **SHAP** for global feature importance



##  Dataset

**Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**

The dataset includes:

* Demographics and medical measurements of individuals
* Binary target indicating diabetes diagnosis
* Designed for predictive modeling in healthcare analytics


### Tools & Libraries
